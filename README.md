# PCB's 3D layouts 
---
This repo contrains my pcb design based on various technology.

* DC motor driver.
Motor driver are the devices use for controlling motors.Drivers circuits based on BJT, MOSFET, SCR'S and many switching devices.
and controlled by PWM , GPIO's signals.
PCB is designed using on MOSFET BTS7960 IC.
for six dc motors at same time with reverse voltage protection.

* Power bench supply.

* USB-TTL programmer.

* STM32 custom dev-board v1.0.

* STM32 custom dev-board v1.1.

* flight computer.

* TVC flight computer.

* ESP-DEV BOARD.

* ESP-GPS.

* Low power supply unit.

* FPGA dev-board.

* SOC
