# PCB's 3D layout's
---
This repository contrains my pcb design based on various technology. each project has different repository resources for more info.

1) DC motor driver.
Motor driver are the devices use for controlling motors.Drivers circuits based on BJT, MOSFET, SCR'S and many switching devices.
and controlled by PWM , GPIO's signals.
PCB is designed using on MOSFET BTS7960 IC.
for  six dc motors at same time with reverse voltage protection.
