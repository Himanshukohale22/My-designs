# PCB's 3D layout's
---
This repository contrains my pcb design based on various technology. each project has different repository resources for more info.



## 1) DC motor driver.

---

Motor driver are the devices use for controlling motors.Drivers circuits based on BJT, MOSFET, SCR'S and many switching devices.
and controlled by PWM , GPIO's signals.
PCB is designed using on MOSFET BTS7960 IC.
for  six dc motors at same time with reverse voltage protection.
